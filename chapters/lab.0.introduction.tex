\chapter*{Introduction to the MOS Lab}

\textbf{Welcome to the MOS Lab!}

MOS is a microkernel operating system, it's designed to be simple and easy to understand.
During the lab, you will be working with the MOS kernel and exploring corresponding concepts of
operating systems.

Throughout the labs, you will explore the following topics, in the order listed. Items in
\textbf{bold} are the main topics of the lab, which you may be asked to implement something for.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Lab 1}: Development Environment Setup
          \subitem Cross-Compiler Usage
          \subitem Starting the \textbf{QEMU} emulator and attach to it with \textbf{GDB}
    \item \textbf{Lab 2}: Process and Threads
          \subitem \textbf{PCB} \textbf{TCB}, process tables and thread tables
          \subitem \textbf{Creating} a new process
          \subitem \textbf{The famous \texttt{fork()} syscall}
    \item \textbf{Lab 3}: Synchronization
          \subitem \textbf{Synchronization Primitives} such as \textbf{mutex}
          \subitem \textbf{Futex} - Fast User-space Mutex
    \item \textbf{Lab 4}: Memory Management
          \subitem \textbf{Paging}, \textbf{Virtual Memory} and \textbf{Address Spaces}
          \subitem \textbf{Copy-on-Write} and \textbf{Page Fault}
\end{itemize}
