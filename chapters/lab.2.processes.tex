\chapter{Lab 2 - Processes}

Congratulations on completing the first lab! Hopefully you have had a chance to play
around with the MOS kernel and have a better understanding of its structure.

In this lab, we will be looking at the process management in MOS.

\section{Files in MOS that relate to process management}

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \caption{The header and source files in \texttt{kernel/tasks}}
    \label{fig:mos-process-management-files}
\end{figure}

The process management in MOS is implemented in the \texttt{kernel/tasks} directory, and the
corresponding header files are in \texttt{kernel/include/private/mos/tasks} as shown in
Figure \ref{fig:mos-process-management-files}.

\begin{note}
    \item The \texttt{kernel/include/private} directory is a convension used in MOS, which
    contains the header files that are \textbf{not} meant to be used by userspace programs.
\end{note}

\section{Process Control Blocks}

You have learnt about this in the lecture: `a process is a program in execution', and a process
control block (PCB) is a data structure that contains information about a process.

Now, let's look at the PCB structure in MOS. The PCB is defined as a struct named \texttt{process\_t}
in \texttt{task\_types.h}.

Several fields are defined in PCB, but we will only look at the ones that are relevant to
process management, which are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{pid}: The process id.

          Each process has a unique id, this is what MOS uses to identify a process.\\
          In MOS, the process id is an unsigned 32-bit integer, and this number always
          increases.

    \item \texttt{name}: The name of the process, nothing interesting here.

    \item \texttt{parent}: The parent of the process, this is a pointer to the PCB of the parent.

          Unlike most animals, a process can only have one parent. The \texttt{init}
          process lives at the root of the process tree, it's fun to think about it being its own
          parent.

    \item \texttt{files}: A list of opened files.

          This is a statically allocated array of size \texttt{MOS\_PROCESS\_MAX\_OPEN\_FILES},
          the value of which is determined by the kernel configuration.

          Each time a file is opened, an \texttt{io\_t} that represents an IO object (file, pipe, etc.)
          is added to this array, and the index of such an object is returned to the user program.

          This index is called a `file descriptor', or `fd' for short. The user program can use
          this number to refer to the file in the future.

          The \texttt{io\_t} structure is defined in \texttt{kernel/include/private/mos/io/io.h},
          the details of which is probably beyond the scope of this lab.

    \item \texttt{threads}: A list of threads.

          To be honest, this list is unnecessary, because we already have a thread table elsewhere
          in MOS, the list here is just a convenience for the kernel to iterate over all threads
          of a specific process, (think about it as a cache).

    \item \texttt{pagetable}, \texttt{mmaps}: The page table and a list of mapped memory regions,
          these two will be discussed in later chapters.
\end{itemize}

\section{Thread Control Blocks}

You may have noticed that the PCB above is \textit{little bit} different from the one in the
lecture: It has neither `process state' nor `stack/heap/text memory regions'.

Because, in MOS, a thread is basic unit of execution instead of a process. Thus it's the thread that has a
`state' and a `stack', and the process is just a collection of threads.

The thread control block is defined in the same file as the PCB. You can see that it contains
a \texttt{tid} for a thread id, and a \texttt{state} field to indicate the state of the thread,
its owner process, two stacks for the kernel and user mode respectively. There's also a
\texttt{context} pointer, this will be used in context switching, we'll look at that later.

\section{Process Creation}

To create a process, the following steps are taken:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Load the program into the memory.
    \item Create a PCB and populate the fields.
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Allocate and initialize the PCB.
              \item Allocate a user-mode page table.
              \item Parse the program and map corresponding memory regions into the page table.
              \item Allocate a heap for the process in the user-mode page table.
                    (part 2 in Figure \ref{fig:mos-process-memory-layout})
              \item Add the PCB to the process table.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Create a main thread.
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Allocate and initialize the TCB for the main thread.
              \item Allocate \textbf{both} the user-space and kernel-space stack space for the thread.
                    (part 2 in Figure \ref{fig:mos-process-memory-layout})
              \item Add the thread to the thread table.
              \item Set thread state to \texttt{CREATED}.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item (optionally) schedule to the new thread.
\end{enumerate}

A process has to be created from a `program' (an executable file) in order to be executed.
In MOS, the format called `ELF' is used as the executable format.

Thus, to be honest, the journey of a process should start from the function \texttt{elf\_create\_process}
located in \texttt{kernel/elf/elf.c} (corresponding to the first step above), but the code for
parsing an ELF file is a bit overcomplicated and not very interesting.

Because of that, we'll jump ahead and begin at the \texttt{process\_new} function.

\subsection{\texttt{process\_new}}

This function is defined in file \texttt{kernel/tasks/process.c}. It accepts several arguments,
the important ones among them are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{process\_t *parent}: The parent of the process, this is a pointer to the PCB of the parent.
    \item \texttt{const char *name}: The name of the process, this is just a string that is used for debugging.
    \item \texttt{thread\_entry\_t entry}: The entry point of the process, this is the address of the
          \texttt{main} function of the program.
\end{itemize}

The function first allocates a PCB by calling \texttt{process\_allocate}. In that function, a
\texttt{process\_t} structure is allocated and initialized. The PID, magic number, name and
parent are set, then it calls \texttt{mm\_create\_user\_pgd} to create a user-mode page table,
which will become the `address space' of the process.

Going back to \texttt{process\_new}, several (precisely, 3) calls to \texttt{process\_attach\_ref\_fd}
are made to attach the standard input, output and error streams to the process.

Then the function calls \texttt{thread\_new} to create a main thread for the process. As you can see,
the \texttt{entry} is passed as the argument.

\begin{note}
    \item The function also passes \texttt{NULL} as the \texttt{arg} argument, which is an implementation
    detail that MOS handles arguments for the main thread differently.
\end{note}

After the main thread is created, the function allocates a heap by calling \texttt{mm\_alloc\_pages}
and then completes the initialization of the PCB by adding the PCB into the process table.

We'll now look at the \texttt{thread\_new} function.

\subsection{\texttt{thread\_new}}

This function is defined in file \texttt{kernel/tasks/thread.c}.

Similarly, it firstly calls \texttt{thread\_allocate} to allocate a TCB for the thread, which
initializes the \texttt{tid}, \texttt{magic}, \texttt{owner}, \texttt{state} and \texttt{mode}
fields.

After a TCB is allocated, the function allocates two types of stacks for the thread:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Kernel Mode Stack}

          This is the stack used when the thread is running in kernel mode. A thread is running
          in `kernel mode' when it is executing a system call, or when a hardware interrupt, such as
          a timer interrupt or a keyboard interrupt, occurs.

    \item \textbf{User Mode Stack}

          This is the stack used when the thread is running in user mode, nothing special here?
\end{itemize}

\begin{tip}
    \item Pay attention to the different \texttt{mm\_} functions used to allocate the stacks.
    The kernel stack is allocated by \texttt{mm\_alloc\_pages}, while the user stack is
    allocated by \texttt{mm\_alloc\_zeroed\_pages}.
    \item The reason for this will be explained in the later chapters.
\end{tip}

After stacks are allocated, the function calls \texttt{platform\_context\_setup}, which is
a platform-specific function that setup the initial context of the thread.

Although we won't go into details into architecture-specific code, it's worth noting it's here
that the \texttt{entry} and \texttt{arg} arguments are used. For example, the entry will be
the initial instruction pointer of the thread and the \texttt{arg} will be pushed onto the stack
or passed in a register (depending on the architecture).

After the context is setup, the function adds the thread into the thread table, completing
the initialization of that thread.

\subsection{Thread States}

In MOS, a thread can be in one of the following states:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{CREATED}: thread is created or forked, but not ever started
    \item \texttt{READY}: thread can be scheduled
    \item \texttt{RUNNING}: thread is currently running
    \item \texttt{BLOCKED}: thread is blocked by a wait condition
    \item \texttt{DEAD}: thread is dead, and will be cleaned up soon by the scheduler
\end{itemize}

The state transition diagram of a thread is shown in Figure \ref{fig:thread-state-transition}
\footnote{Process termination with multiple running threads is not shown in this diagram}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[auto]

        \node[state] (C) at (0,-2) {CREATED};
        \node[state] (D) at (0, 2) {DEAD};

        \node[state] (U) at (3, 1) {RUNNING};
        \node[state] (R) at (9, 1) {READY};
        \node[state] (B) at (6,-3) {BLOCKED};

        \draw[->, thick] (-2, -2) -- (C);

        \path[->] (C) edge node {initial run} (U);
        \path[->] (U) edge node {exit} (D);

        \path[->] (U) edge [bend right] node {interrupted} (R);
        \path[->] (R) edge [bend right] node {scheduled} (U);
        \path[->] (U) edge [bend right] node {wait} (B);
        \path[->] (B) edge [bend right] node {wakeup} (R);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Thread State Transition Diagram in MOS}
    \label{fig:thread-state-transition}
\end{figure}

\begin{note}
    \item MOS transitions a thread from \texttt{CREATED} \textbf{directly} to
    \texttt{RUNNING} without going through the \texttt{READY} state. This is different
    from what's in the lecture, where a thread is then \texttt{admitted}.

    This is because the scheduler in MOS require state as an indicator of whether a thread
    needs special setup before really jumping to the thread entry point.
\end{note}

In later chapters, we'll see what really happens when a thread is scheduled, blocked
or woken up. For now, we'll just focus on the process and thread creation.

\subsection{Process Address Space}

In MOS, a process has a virtual address space that is shared by all its threads. This is
similar to what Linux does. The underlying mechanism is called `paging' which we'll
also cover in later chapters.

The figure \ref{fig:mos-process-memory-layout} shows the memory layout of a process in MOS
after its creation.

\subsection{Exercises for Part 1}

\begin{exercise}
    \item Read the code in \texttt{process.c}, find the function \texttt{process\_dump\_mmaps()}
    \item Print the memory map of the \texttt{init} process in \texttt{mos\_start\_kernel}.
    \item Find out where is those memory map information is added to the process, and try
    print out a log message each time a new memory map is added.
\end{exercise}

\section{The famous \texttt{fork()} system call}

You may have known that the \texttt{fork()} system call is used to create a new process, which
seems to be the same as what we have just discussed. However, think about the following
question:

\begin{quote}
    What if we want to create a new process that is exactly the same as the current process,
    instead of creating a new process from a program?
\end{quote}

This is what \texttt{fork()} does. It creates a new process that is exactly the same as the
current process, including the memory layout, the file descriptors (opened files), etc.

In this section, we'll try to implement \texttt{fork()} in MOS.

The actual fork code is located in \texttt{fork.c}, which contains only one function
that we need to implement: \texttt{process\_handle\_fork()}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Being different from normal process creation, we need more control over this new process
          created by \texttt{fork()}. We need to manually specify the entry point of the new process,
          its context, its memory layout and so on.

          So the first step is to use \texttt{process\_allocate} to create a new process, and
          use \texttt{thread\_allocate} to create a new thread for this process.

    \item The next step is to copy the opened files from the current process to the new process.
          You should just follow the instructions in the file to implement this step.

    \item The next step is to copy the memory layout from the current process to the new process.
          There are also instructions in the file to help you implement this step.

          \textbf{Note}: For a good implementation, no actual copying is needed.
          (in fact, you just cannot copy between address spaces).

    \item The next step is to copy the context from the current thread to the new thread.
          This is done for you by the function \texttt{platform\_setup\_forked\_context}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Test your implementation}

After you have implemented \texttt{process\_handle\_fork()}, you can test your implementation
by running the following command:

\begin{minted}{bash}
    qemu-system-i386 \
        -kernel mos_multiboot.bin \
        -initrd initrd.cpio \
        -append "init=/initrd/tests/lab2.1" \
        -m 4G -serial stdio
\end{minted}

For a correct implementation, you should see the following output:

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{assets/c2.lab2.png}
    \caption{The output of \texttt{lab2.1}}

\end{figure}
